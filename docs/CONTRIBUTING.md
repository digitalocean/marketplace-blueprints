# Contributing
We would love your contributions! You are welcome to open a pull request for a new blueprint or update an existing one.

## How to contribute
Here are the steps required to add your blueprint to the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/):

### Step 0: Make sure you are a vendor
To create a new application, you must have an account within the [DigitalOcean Marketplace Vendor Portal](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/vendorportal). 
You can learn [here](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/vendors) about how to become a vendor.

### Step 1: Clone (or fork) the repository
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-blueprints.git
```

### Step 2: Create a git branch that includes the name of your blueprint
```shell
$ git checkout -b my-blueprint-init-pr
```

### Step 3: Create your blueprint
Check our blueprint [template](../template/) and documentation to learn how to create your own blueprint.

**Note: your new blueprint must be in the `blueprints` folder. Use our blueprint [generator](../scripts/generate-blueprint.sh) to avoid any structural problem. **

### Step 4: Create pull request and leave it to us
After you will create a pull request, our team will be notified, and we will review your pull request in no time.
